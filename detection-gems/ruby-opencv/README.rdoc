The initial Open Computer Vision library was originally developed by Intel 
Corporation. Recent development has been headed by Willow Garage, Inc.

== DESCRIPTION:

OpenCV Ruby Wrapper

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* First release rubygems, Some OpenCV functions wrapped.

== DEPENDENCIES:

This gem relies on the OpenCV project. There are a number of ways to install
the library. Building the latest from source is preferred on OSX:
  
  http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Mac_OS_X_OpenCV_Port

This also contains the data for the default cascades.

== INSTALLATION:

You can install by cloning this repository:

  git clone git://github.com/jeffrafter/ruby-opencv.git
  
Then inside the ruby-opencv folder run:

  ruby ext/extconf.rb
  make
  sudo make install

== SYNOPSIS:

Once installed it is possible to show images via GUI Window.

  require "rubygems"
  gem "opencv"
  require "opencv"

  image = OpenCV::IplImage.load("sample.jpg")
  window = OpenCV::GUI::Window.new("preview")
  window.show(image)
  OpenCV::GUI::wait_key

For more samples, see examples/*.rb

== FACE DETECTION:

Here is a sample face detection program that doesn't rely on the GUI components.
In order for this to work you must copy the OpenCV haarcascades data into a 
subfolder called data.

  #!/usr/bin/env ruby
  require "rubygems"
  require "opencv"

  if ARGV.length < 2
    puts "Usage: your_app_name source dest"
    exit
  end
 
  data = "./data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml"
  detector = OpenCV::CvHaarClassifierCascade::load(data)
  image = OpenCV::IplImage.load(ARGV[0])
  detector.detect_objects(image) do |region|
    color = OpenCV::CvColor::Blue
    image.rectangle! region.top_left, region.bottom_right, :color => color
  end
  image.save_image(ARGV[1])

== REQUIREMENTS:

* OpenCV 2.0 or later.
