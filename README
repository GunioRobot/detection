OpenCV is under BSD License and the API is under MIT/GPL

You can try the API at http://detection.myvhost.de/

== Install

1. Install ruby1.9.1 and git
2. Install postgresql server
3. Run the setup script with sudo rights
4. Start the rails application
5. Start one runner, register it and you should be ready to go.
